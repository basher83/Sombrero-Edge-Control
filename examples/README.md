# Examples Directory

This directory serves as a repository for capturing official and unofficial examples that demonstrate best practices for infrastructure automation and configuration management within the Sombrero Edge Control project.

## Purpose

The examples directory is designed to:

- **Showcase Best Practices**: Provide real-world examples of proper Ansible configuration, playbook structure, and role organization
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as learning materials for understanding complex automation patterns and techniques
- **Reference Implementation**: Offer tested code snippets and configurations that can be adapted for similar use cases
- **Community Contributions**: House both official project examples and community-contributed solutions

## Current Contents

### ansible-ansible-documentation/

A comprehensive collection of Ansible best practices and configuration examples sourced from official Ansible documentation:

#### `defaults/`

- **Configuration Files**: Sample `ansible.cfg`, inventory files (`hosts`, `hosts.yml`, `hosts.yaml`)
- **Documentation Templates**: Module documentation template (`DOCUMENTATION.yml`)
- **Comprehensive Playbook**: Extensively commented playbook example (`play.yml`) demonstrating advanced Ansible features
- **Plugin Examples**: Custom filter plugin configurations (`plugin_filters.yml`)

#### `tips-tricks/`

- **Best Practices Guide**: Comprehensive tips and tricks for Ansible development (`general-tips-tricks.md`)
- **Role Structure**: Visual guide to proper role directory organization (`role-directory.md`)
- **Sample Applications**: Complete web application automation example (`sample-web-app.md`)
- **Practical Examples**: Working YAML files demonstrating:
  - Dynamic host grouping (`group_by.yaml`, `group_hosts.yml`)
  - Variable inclusion patterns (`include_vars.yaml`)

### sensu-sensu-go-install/

Monitoring system integration example:

- **Argument Specifications**: Complete argument specs for Sensu Go installation role (`argument_specs.yml`)
- Demonstrates proper role entry point documentation and parameter validation

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Learning**: Study the documented examples to understand best practices and patterns
2. **Reference**: Use code snippets as templates for your own implementations
3. **Testing**: Adapt examples to test new concepts in your development environment
4. **Contributing**: Add new examples following the established patterns and documentation standards

## Contributing Examples

When adding new examples to this directory:

1. **Document Thoroughly**: Include comprehensive comments and documentation
2. **Follow Conventions**: Maintain consistency with existing examples
3. **Test Your Code**: Ensure examples work as documented
4. **Provide Context**: Explain the use case and when to apply the example
5. **Update This README**: Add descriptions of new examples to keep this overview current

## Best Practices Demonstrated

The examples in this directory showcase:

- **Ansible Role Structure**: Proper organization of tasks, handlers, templates, and variables
- **Playbook Design**: Clear, maintainable playbook patterns with appropriate use of tags and variables
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive module and role documentation
- **Variable Management**: Secure handling of sensitive data and environment-specific configurations
- **Testing Patterns**: Examples of validation and testing approaches
- **Code Organization**: Logical separation of concerns and reusable components
