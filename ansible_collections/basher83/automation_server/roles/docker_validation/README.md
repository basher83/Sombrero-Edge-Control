# Docker Validation Role

This role provides comprehensive Docker environment validation for production deployments
in the Sombrero Edge Control infrastructure. It replaces manual Docker validation commands
with idempotent Ansible tasks covering all aspects of Docker container management.

## Research Background

Based on comprehensive research of Ansible collections for Docker validation:

### Primary Collections Used

- **community.docker v4.7.0** (Score: 92/100) - Official Docker lifecycle management and validation
- **prometheus.community v87/100** (Score: 87/100) - Container monitoring and metrics collection
- **community.general v11.2.1** (Score: 85/100) - System-level validation and support functions

### Collection Quality Assessment

Research conducted using ansible-research subagent with 100-point scoring system evaluating:

- Docker-specific functionality coverage
- Production deployment readiness
- Security and compliance features
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Community support and maintenance activity

## Role Overview

This role implements comprehensive Docker validation across six key areas:

1. **Docker Engine Validation** - Daemon health, version compatibility, storage, network
1. **Container Lifecycle Management** - State validation, resource monitoring, log analysis
1. **Image Management** - Availability, integrity, security, registry connectivity
1. **Docker Compose & Stack Validation** - Service health, dependencies, discovery
1. **Security & Compliance** - Container security, privileges, secrets, runtime policies
1. **Performance & Resource Monitoring** - Utilization metrics, I/O validation, contention

## Features

### Docker Engine Validation

- Docker daemon health and version compatibility checks

- Container log analysis and error detection
- Container restart policy and dependency validation
- Multi-container application orchestration verification

### Image Security & Integrity

- Image availability and pull capability testing
- Image layer integrity and size validation
- Container registry connectivity and authentication
- Image security scanning integration (when available)
- Base image vulnerability assessment

### Docker Compose Integration

- Service stack health checking and validation
- Multi-container application dependency verification
- Volume and network dependency validation
- Service discovery and load balancer testing
- Docker Compose v2 compatibility validation

### Security Validation

- Container security posture and configuration assessment
- User namespace and privilege escalation validation
- Secret and environment variable security verification
- Runtime security policy compliance checking
- Container isolation and resource limit validation

### Performance Monitoring

- Container resource utilization metrics collection
- Docker engine performance monitoring and alerting
- Storage and network I/O performance validation
- Multi-container resource contention detection
- Integration with Prometheus and cAdvisor for monitoring

        expected_containers:
          - name: "nginx"
            state: "running"
            health_status: "healthy"
          - name: "postgres"

```

## Variables

See `defaults/main.yml` for all configurable variables including:

- Docker engine requirements and thresholds
- Container validation criteria
- Image management settings
- Security compliance rules
- Performance monitoring configuration
- Integration settings for monitoring systems

## Dependencies

- community.docker >= 4.7.0
- community.general >= 8.0.0
- prometheus.community (optional, for monitoring)
- Python docker library >= 5.0.0
- Docker Engine >= 20.10.0
- Docker Compose v2.0+ (for compose validation)

## Testing

This role includes Molecule tests for comprehensive validation:

```bash
# Run all tests
molecule test

# Test specific scenario
molecule converge -s docker-engine
molecule converge -s container-validation
molecule converge -s security-validation
```

## Integration

Designed to integrate with:

- VM deployment and provisioning workflows
- Container orchestration platforms
- Monitoring and alerting systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
- CI/CD deployment pipelines
- Security scanning and compliance tools

## Migration Notes

This role replaces the following manual operations:

- Direct `docker` command execution for validation
- Manual container health checking
- Shell-based Docker daemon monitoring
- Manual image and registry verification
- Direct Docker Compose stack validation

All operations are now:

- ✅ **Idempotent**: Consistent validation results across runs
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Full coverage of Docker environment validation
- ✅ **Structured**: JSON/YAML output for integration with monitoring
- ✅ **Secure**: Proper handling of credentials and sensitive information
- ✅ **Production-Ready**: Error handling, logging, and reporting suitable for production

## Security Considerations

- Docker socket access requires appropriate permissions
- Container privilege validation prevents escalation risks
- Secrets and environment variables are handled securely
- Network and storage validation ensures proper isolation
- Integration with security scanning tools for vulnerability assessment

## Performance Impact

- Validation tasks are designed to be minimally invasive
- Parallel validation where possible to reduce execution time
- Configurable validation depth to balance thoroughness vs. speed
- Caching mechanisms for repeated validations
- Integration with monitoring systems for continuous validation
