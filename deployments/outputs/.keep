# Deployment Pipeline Outputs

This directory stores JSON output files that pass data between pipeline stages:

- `packer-outputs.json` - Template IDs and build artifacts from Packer
- `terraform-outputs.json` - Infrastructure details (IPs, hostnames) from Terraform
- `ansible-results.json` - Configuration status and service details from Ansible

These files enable automatic data passing in the Packer → Terraform → Ansible pipeline.
Files are automatically generated during deployment runs.
