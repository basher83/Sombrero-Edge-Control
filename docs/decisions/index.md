# 🏗️ Sombrero Edge Control - Architecture Knowledge Base

**Welcome to the architectural decision log for Sombrero Edge Control** - a comprehensive infrastructure-as-code project for deploying secure, containerized workloads on Proxmox Virtual Environment.

This knowledge base contains all Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that guide the technical direction and implementation choices for our edge computing infrastructure.

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

### Current ADRs by Category

## 🎯 Purpose & Benefits

> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

Our ADRs serve to:

- 🚀 **Accelerate Onboarding** - New team members can understand "why" decisions were made
- 🔭 **Prevent Decision Regression** - Historical context prevents repeating past mistakes
- 🤝 **Formalize Decision Process** - Collaborative, documented approach to technical choices
- 📈 **Enable Evolution** - Clear foundation for future architectural changes

## 🔄 ADR Lifecycle

ADRs follow this collaborative workflow:

1. **Draft** → Initial proposal and context gathering
2. **Proposed** → Open for review and discussion
3. **Accepted** → Decision implemented and documented
4. **Deprecated/Superseded** → When better alternatives emerge
