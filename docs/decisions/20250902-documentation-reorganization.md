# Documentation Directory Structure Reorganization

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2025-09-02
- Tags: documentation, organization, structure

## Context and Problem Statement

The documentation directory (`docs/`) has grown significantly with 13+ documentation files, making it increasingly difficult to:

- Find relevant information quickly
- Maintain organization as new documents are added
- Understand the relationship between different types of documentation
- Onboard new team members who need to locate specific guides

The current flat structure was becoming unwieldy and didn't provide clear categorization for different user roles (developers, operations, project managers) or functional areas (deployment, development, infrastructure).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Organize documentation by functional areas and user roles", because we needed a scalable structure that would improve discoverability and maintenance while supporting different user types and functional areas.

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved discoverability**: Team members can quickly find relevant documentation by functional area
- **Scalable structure**: Each subdirectory can grow independently without cluttering the main docs directory
- **Role-based organization**: Different user types can navigate to relevant sections
- **Better maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update documentation within logical groupings
- **Enhanced README**: Comprehensive navigation guide helps new team members get oriented quickly
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Deployment, development, and infrastructure docs are logically separated

### Negative Consequences

- **Learning curve**: Team members need to adjust to the new structure and remember directory locations
- **Internal link updates**: Existing internal references needed updating to reflect new file locations
- **Initial disruption**: Short-term confusion during transition period

## Considered Options

### Flat Structure with Naming Convention

**Description**: Use consistent file naming prefixes and keep all files in the root docs directory

- Good, because: Minimal structural changes required
- Good, because: Easy to implement quickly
- Bad, because: Doesn't provide visual separation
- Bad, because: Still results in cluttered directory listing
- Bad, because: Harder to browse related documents

### Topic-Based Organization

**Description**: Organize by topics rather than functional areas

- Good, because: Groups related technical content together
- Good, because: Easier for technical specialists
- Bad, because: Mixes concerns across different user roles
- Bad, because: Harder for specific team members to find what they need
- Bad, because: Less intuitive for cross-cutting concerns
