Technical Story: Needed a system to capture operational knowledge, deployment decisions, and troubleshooting notes without cluttering the infrastructure codebase, inspired by HumanLayer's thoughts management approach.

## Context and Problem Statement

Infrastructure operations generate significant operational knowledge (deployment decisions, incident resolutions, debugging sessions) that is valuable but doesn't belong in the main codebase. How can we capture and organize this knowledge while keeping it accessible to both team members and AI assistants, without adding complexity to our infrastructure repository?

## Decision Drivers

- **Knowledge Retention**: Need to preserve operational decisions and troubleshooting history
- **Repository Cleanliness**: Keep infrastructure code focused and uncluttered
- **AI Assistant Context**: Provide rich operational context for AI-powered assistance
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable knowledge sharing without formal documentation overhead
- **Simplicity**: Avoid adding complex dependencies or runtime components
- **Security**: Keep sensitive operational details out of public repositories

## Considered Options

1. **Full HumanLayer Integration** - Complete integration with HumanLayer platform including approval workflows
1. **Thoughts Directory Only** - Adapt HumanLayer's thoughts directory concept without the platform
1. **Traditional Wiki** - Use external wiki or documentation platform
1. **Expand docs/ Directory** - Keep everything in existing documentation structure
1. **No Change** - Continue with ad-hoc notes and lost context

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Thoughts Directory Only"**, because it provides the perfect balance of functionality and simplicity for infrastructure knowledge management without introducing unnecessary complexity or external dependencies.

### Positive Consequences

- **Zero Runtime Dependencies**: Just directories and git hooks - no daemons, APIs, or external services
- **Infrastructure-Aligned Structure**: Directory structure maps perfectly to infrastructure concerns (deployments, incidents, runbooks)
- **AI-Friendly**: Structured format with CLAUDE.md makes knowledge easily discoverable by AI assistants
- **Team Knowledge Building**: Shared space for operational insights without formal documentation burden
- **Git Integration**: Protected from accidental commits via .gitignore and pre-commit hooks
- **Immediate Value**: Can start capturing knowledge immediately with no setup overhead

### Negative Consequences

- **No Approval Workflows**: Unlike full HumanLayer, no built-in approval mechanisms (mitigated by existing PR/Terraform plan workflows)
- **Manual Sync**: No automated sync to separate repository (can be added later if needed)
- **Limited Search**: No advanced search features beyond filesystem/grep (sufficient for current needs)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Full HumanLayer Integration

Complete integration with HumanLayer platform for human-in-the-loop AI operations.

- Good, because provides approval workflows for sensitive operations
- Good, because includes sophisticated human-AI interaction capabilities
- Good, because offers multiple contact channels (Slack, email, web)
- Bad, because requires running daemon (hld) and API infrastructure
- Bad, because designed for AI agent approvals, not infrastructure knowledge management
- Bad, because adds significant complexity for limited benefit in infrastructure context
- Bad, because infrastructure already has approval mechanisms (PRs, Terraform plan)

### Thoughts Directory Only [CHOSEN]

Adapt HumanLayer's thoughts directory concept without the platform dependencies.

- Good, because provides structured knowledge management without complexity
- Good, because zero external dependencies or runtime requirements
- Good, because perfectly aligned with infrastructure operational needs
- Good, because maintains separation between code and operational knowledge
- Good, because easy to implement and maintain
- Good, because provides AI context through structured directories and CLAUDE.md
- Bad, because no automated approval workflows (not needed for our use case)
- Bad, because no built-in sync to separate repository (can be added later)

### Traditional Wiki

Use Confluence, MediaWiki, or similar external platform.

- Good, because provides rich editing and search capabilities
- Good, because established documentation patterns
- Bad, because requires external service and authentication
- Bad, because creates context switching between code and documentation
- Bad, because harder to keep synchronized with code changes
- Bad, because less accessible to AI assistants

### Expand docs/ Directory

Keep all operational knowledge in the existing docs/ structure.

- Good, because single location for all documentation
- Good, because already part of repository
- Bad, because mixes polished documentation with work-in-progress notes
- Bad, because operational notes clutter the formal documentation
- Bad, because harder to distinguish between temporary and permanent documentation

### No Change

Continue with current ad-hoc approach.

- Good, because no implementation effort required
- Bad, because knowledge continues to be lost
- Bad, because no structure for operational insights
- Bad, because AI assistants lack operational context
- Bad, because team knowledge sharing remains difficult

## Implementation Details

The implemented thoughts directory structure:

```
thoughts/
├── shared/                     # Team-shared infrastructure knowledge
│   ├── deployments/           # Deployment decisions and logs
│   ├── incidents/             # Incident reports and resolutions
│   ├── runbooks/              # Operational procedures
│   ├── architecture/          # Architecture decisions and research
│   └── migrations/            # Infrastructure migration plans
├── {username}/                # Personal infrastructure notes
│   ├── experiments/           # Personal testing and experiments
│   ├── debugging/             # Personal debugging sessions
│   └── notes/                 # General personal notes
├── global/                    # Cross-repository infrastructure knowledge
└── searchable/               # AI-searchable index (future enhancement)
```

Protection mechanisms:

- Added to `.gitignore` to prevent repository commits
- Pre-commit hook configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- CLAUDE.md provides AI assistant context and usage guidelines
