### Key Performance Indicators

#### Tool Independence
#### Tool Independence
- [ ] Packer builds without Terraform/Ansible dependencies
  - DoD: packer build succeeds using only packer/; no external scripts
  - Artifact: template ID published to deployments/outputs/template.json
  - Tests: packer-validate and post‚Äëbuild smoke in mise task `packer-validate`
- [ ] Terraform deploys with only template ID input
  - DoD: tf apply with -var template_id=<ID> only; no provisioners
  - Output: inventory.json emitted to deployments/outputs/
- [ ] Ansible configures with only inventory JSON input
  - DoD: ansible-playbook -i inventory.json site.yml completes idempotently
  - Idempotency: <= 0 changed tasks on second run
- [ ] Each tool has independent test suite
  - DoD: packer tests (smoke), Terraform (terratest), Ansible (molecule)
#### Performance Metrics

- [ ] Packer build time: < 7 minutes
- [ ] Terraform deployment: < 2 minutes
- [ ] Ansible configuration: < 5 minutes
- [ ] End-to-end deployment: < 60 seconds total

#### Quality Metrics

- [ ] Image size: < 2GB (currently ~4GB with Docker)
- [ ] Test coverage: > 80% per tool
- [ ] Zero coupling violations between tools
- [ ] Documentation: 100% of components documented

## Resource Allocation

### Current Team Focus

- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-init fixes, performance validation
- **Ansible**: Collection migration, smoke test integration
- **Testing**: Unit test implementation, CI/CD completion
- **Documentation**: Production README fix, role documentation

### Recommended Priorities

1. **Week 1**: Fix blockers, validate performance
2. **Week 2-3**: Ansible migration execution
3. **Week 4-6**: Testing and CI/CD completion
4. **Week 7-8**: Production validation and deployment

## Risk Register

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance claims false | Project credibility | Immediate validation required |
| Cloud-init files missing | Deployment failure | Create files immediately |
| Ansible migration stalled | Technical debt | Execute phase 1 now |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| No unit tests | Quality issues | Implement Terratest |
| Manual deployments | Human error | Automate pipeline |
| Security gaps | Compliance failure | Add validation tests |
