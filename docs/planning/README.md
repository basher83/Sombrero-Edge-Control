# Project Planning Documentation

This directory contains strategic planning documents, architectural decisions, and implementation roadmaps for the Sombrero Edge Control project.

## Directory Structure

### [ansible-refactor/](./ansible-refactor/)

Comprehensive planning for the Ansible-first infrastructure refactor, moving from direct SSH operations to role-based Ansible architecture.

- **[refactor-plan.md](./ansible-refactor/refactor-plan.md)** - Complete refactor plan and implementation strategy
- **[role-specifications.md](./ansible-refactor/role-specifications.md)** - Detailed specifications for each Ansible role
- **[migration-strategy.md](./ansible-refactor/migration-strategy.md)** - Step-by-step migration from current state
- **[testing-strategy.md](./ansible-refactor/testing-strategy.md)** - Validation and testing approach

### [tooling-migrations/](./tooling-migrations/)

Planning and documentation for tooling migrations and modernization efforts.

- **[MEGALINTER_MIGRATION.md](./tooling-migrations/MEGALINTER_MIGRATION.md)** - Complete MegaLinter migration guide and implementation
- **[README.md](./tooling-migrations/README.md)** - Overview of completed and planned tooling migrations

### [architecture-decisions/](./architecture-decisions/)

Long-term architectural decisions and their rationale.

- **[ADR-2025-01-06-ansible-roles.md](./architecture-decisions/ADR-2025-01-06-ansible-roles.md)** - Decision to adopt Ansible role-first architecture

## Purpose

This planning documentation serves to:

1. **Document Strategic Decisions** - Capture the "why" behind major architectural changes
2. **Plan Complex Refactors** - Break down large changes into manageable phases
3. **Facilitate Collaboration** - Provide a space for iterative planning and feedback
4. **Track Progress** - Monitor implementation against planned objectives

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Projects

#### MegaLinter Migration (September 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Goal**: Replace 7 individual linting tools with unified MegaLinter setup
**Impact**: 60%+ faster CI execution, enhanced reporting, centralized configuration
**Documentation**: [MEGALINTER_MIGRATION.md](./tooling-migrations/MEGALINTER_MIGRATION.md)

### 🔄 Active Projects

#### Ansible-First Refactor (January 2025)

**Status**: Planning Phase
**Goal**: Eliminate all direct SSH operations in favor of Ansible roles
**Impact**: Improved maintainability, testability, and adherence to best practices

## Process

1. **Proposal** - Document the proposed change with rationale
2. **Review** - Gather feedback and iterate on the plan
3. **Approval** - Finalize the plan with stakeholder agreement
4. **Implementation** - Execute in defined phases
5. **Validation** - Verify against success criteria

## Contributing
