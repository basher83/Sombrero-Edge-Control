# Thoughts System Adaptation for Infrastructure Repository

## Overview

Adapting the HumanLayer thoughts system for infrastructure-as-code repositories to manage operational knowledge, deployment decisions, and troubleshooting notes separately from infrastructure code while maintaining seamless integration.

## Key Benefits for Infrastructure Workflows

### 1. Operational Knowledge Management
- **Deployment logs**: Track deployment decisions and outcomes without cluttering Terraform code
- **Incident notes**: Document troubleshooting sessions and resolutions
- **Research findings**: Keep infrastructure research (new Proxmox features, Ansible patterns) accessible but separate
- **Personal experiments**: Test configurations and ideas without affecting team's codebase

### 2. Team Collaboration
- **Shared runbooks**: Collaborative operational procedures
- **Architecture decisions**: Draft ADRs before formalizing them
- **Post-mortems**: Incident analysis and lessons learned
- **Migration plans**: Document infrastructure migration strategies

### 3. AI-Enhanced Operations
- **Context for AI assistants**: Structured thoughts help Claude/other AI understand infrastructure decisions
- **Searchable knowledge base**: Quick access to past solutions and patterns
- **Automated documentation**: Generate deployment summaries from thoughts

## Proposed Directory Structure

```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure (Minimal MVP)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple init script for thoughts directory

# Create thoughts directory structure
mkdir -p thoughts/{shared,$(whoami),global,searchable}
mkdir -p thoughts/shared/{deployments,incidents,runbooks,architecture,migrations}
mkdir -p thoughts/$(whoami)/{experiments,debugging,notes}

# Add to .gitignore
echo "thoughts/" >> .gitignore

# Create initial CLAUDE.md
cat > thoughts/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Thoughts Directory - Infrastructure Knowledge Base

This directory contains operational knowledge, deployment decisions, and troubleshooting notes
for the Sombrero Edge Control infrastructure.

## Structure
- `shared/`: Team-shared infrastructure documentation
- `$(whoami)/`: Your personal infrastructure notes
- `global/`: Cross-repository infrastructure patterns
- `searchable/`: AI-searchable index (read-only)

## Important
- Never commit this directory to the main repository
- Use for work-in-progress documentation
- Move finalized docs to docs/ when ready
EOF
```

### Phase 2: Git Hooks Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit hook to prevent thoughts/ commits
#!/bin/bash
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "^thoughts/"; then
    echo "Error: Attempting to commit thoughts/ directory"
    echo "The thoughts/ directory should not be committed to the main repository"
    git reset HEAD thoughts/
    exit 1
fi
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Separate git repository for thoughts
- Symlink management
- Auto-sync functionality
- Integration with deployment workflows

## Use Cases for Infrastructure

### 1. Deployment Tracking
```markdown
# thoughts/shared/deployments/2025-01-10_production-deploy.md

## Deployment: Jump Host Production
Date: 2025-01-10
Operator: basher8383

### Pre-deployment State
- Previous template: 8024
- Terraform version: 1.13.1

### Decisions Made
- Increased memory to 3GB due to Docker workload
- Added second network interface for isolated management

### Issues Encountered
- SSH key mismatch: resolved by updating cloud-init
- Firewall blocked Docker: updated nftables rules

### Post-deployment Validation
- All smoke tests passed
- Docker containers running
- SSH access confirmed
```

### 2. Incident Documentation
```markdown
# thoughts/shared/incidents/2025-01-09_vm-boot-failure.md

## Incident: VM Boot Failure
Severity: High
Duration: 45 minutes

### Timeline
- 14:00 - VM failed to boot after update
- 14:15 - Identified GRUB configuration issue
- 14:30 - Booted from rescue ISO
- 14:45 - Fixed GRUB, VM operational

### Root Cause
Cloud-init vendor-data corrupted GRUB configuration

### Resolution
1. Boot from Proxmox rescue ISO
2. Mount root filesystem
3. Regenerate GRUB config
4. Update cloud-init template

### Prevention
- Add GRUB validation to smoke tests
- Pin GRUB version in Packer template
```

### 3. Architecture Research
```markdown
# thoughts/shared/architecture/ansible-vault-migration.md

## Research: Migrating from Infisical to Ansible Vault

### Current State
- Using Infisical for secret scanning
- Secrets in .mise.local.toml

### Proposed Architecture
- Ansible Vault for secret storage
- Integration with Terraform via data sources
- Automated rotation via Ansible playbooks

### Benefits
- Reduced external dependencies
- Better GitOps integration
- Native Ansible support

### Implementation Steps
1. Create vault structure
2. Migrate existing secrets
3. Update Terraform providers
4. Test deployment pipeline
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### 1. Deployment Checklist Enhancement
Modify `deployment-start` task to create both checklist and thoughts entry:
```bash
# Create deployment thought
THOUGHT_FILE="thoughts/shared/deployments/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M)-deployment.md"
cat > "$THOUGHT_FILE" << EOF
# Deployment $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
## Pre-deployment
- [ ] Environment variables verified
- [ ] Terraform plan reviewed

## Decisions
<!-- Document any deployment decisions here -->

## Issues
<!-- Track any issues encountered -->
EOF
```

### 2. Smoke Test Integration
Capture smoke test results in thoughts:
```bash
# After smoke tests
if [ "$SMOKE_TEST_RESULT" = "success" ]; then
    echo "✅ All smoke tests passed" >> "$THOUGHT_FILE"
else
    echo "❌ Smoke test failures:" >> "$THOUGHT_FILE"
    echo "$SMOKE_TEST_OUTPUT" >> "$THOUGHT_FILE"
fi
```

### 3. AI Assistant Context
Update CLAUDE.md to reference thoughts:
```markdown
## Available Context
- Infrastructure code in `infrastructure/`
- Ansible playbooks in `ansible/`
- Operational knowledge in `thoughts/shared/`
- Personal notes in `thoughts/$(whoami)/`

When troubleshooting, check:
1. `thoughts/shared/incidents/` for similar issues
2. `thoughts/shared/runbooks/` for procedures
3. `thoughts/shared/deployments/` for recent changes
```

## Benefits Summary

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep operational knowledge separate from infrastructure code
2. **Knowledge Retention**: Preserve troubleshooting and deployment history
3. **Team Learning**: Share insights without cluttering main repository
4. **AI Enhancement**: Provide rich context for AI-assisted operations
5. **Compliance**: Keep sensitive operational details out of public repositories

## Next Steps

1. Create basic thoughts directory structure
2. Add git hooks for protection
3. Document in project README
4. Create mise tasks for thoughts management
5. Integrate with deployment workflows
